## Feedback

Hey guys, Ugochi here. I'll like to give some feedback regarding the coding challenge, state some of the decisions I took, what wasn't done and possible improvements.

To start with, I think the coding challenge tasks were well-defined and easy to understand while still requiring more than basic knowledge of JavaScript and React to implement. Kudos to the folks responsible for creating the challenge.

## Implementation:

1. What libraries did you use? What are they used for? Why did you choose them
specifically?

While it is possible to complete all tasks without the need to use external libraries: 

- I opted to use the `date-fns` library to help work with the different date formats present in the provided data.I recognise that it is possible to work with the different date formats without `date-fns` or other date libraries, but I didn't think it worthwhile to spend more time than required working with native JavaScript dates on such a small part of the challenge.

- I also used `material-ui` for the styling due to time constraint and also to use the `material-ui icons` and `date-time-picker` as this gives me the flexibility to quickly use these components without having to create one from scratch. I understand that I could use regular CSS, but I didn't think it worthwhile to spend more time than required.

2. What improvements or new features would you add if you had more time to work on
the problem?

- I would write Integration test to make sure that each components work the way it should.

- I would rewrite the whole project using pure CSS or Tailwind

3. Which parts did you find most difficult and which parts did you spend the most time
with?

- Because there was no design provided, I had a struggle figuring how the design would be that will be visually appealing and presentable.

4. What are key things to consider when deploying this application for customer
use/production?

## Feedback:

1. How did you find the challenge overall? Did you have any issues or have difficulties
completing?

- The challenge was straight-forward and easy to understand, but the major challenge I had was figuring out the design layout and to make the application visually appealing to the users.

2. We would love to hear any suggestions or improvements you have to make this
challenge better! (Optional)
