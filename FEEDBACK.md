## Feedback

Hey guys, Ugochi here. I'll like to give some feedback regarding the coding challenge, state some of the decisions I took, what wasn't done and possible improvements.

To start with, I think the coding challenge tasks were well-defined and easy to understand while still requiring more than basic knowledge of JavaScript and React to implement. Kudos to the folks responsible for creating the challenge.

- I opted to use the `date-fns` library to help work with the different date formats present in the provided data.I recognise that it is possible to work with the different date formats without `date-fns` or other date libraries, but I didn't think it worthwhile to spend more time than required working with native JavaScript dates on such a small part of the challenge.

- I also used `material-ui` for the styling due to time constraint and also to use the `material-ui icons` and `date-time-picker` as this gives me the flexibility to quickly use these components without having to create one from scratch. I understand that I could use regular CSS, but I didn't think it worthwhile to spend more time than required.
